# Safe Beauty Project

This project utilizes the California Safe Cosmetics Program (CSCP) database to analyze the presence of potentially harmful ingredients in beauty and cosmetic products. The CSCP law requires cosmetic companies to report the presence of these ingredients and is based on Proposition 65, a list of chemicals that have been identified as hazardous to human health.

The aim of the project is to clean and filter the database using Python and Pandas to obtain a new file with products whose formula has been renewed, removing potentially harmful ingredients, as well as those products that have been withdrawn from the market.

Once the new file is obtained, Tableau is used to create visualizations and analyze the results. The analysis includes information on companies and brands that report more potentially harmful ingredients, the most common ingredients, as well as product categories with the highest number of reported ingredients.

This project aims to raise awareness about the presence of potentially harmful ingredients in beauty and cosmetic products and promote the use of safer and healthier products for consumers.
